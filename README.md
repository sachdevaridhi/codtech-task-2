**Objective:**
The objective of the project is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF).

**Steps Involved:**
**Data Loading:**

Load the credit card fraud dataset, which contains transaction details with labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent.
**Data Preprocessing:**

Handle missing values, if any.
Normalize the dataset for better performance of the anomaly detection algorithms.
**Data Splitting:**

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model performance.
**Model Training:**

Train the Isolation Forest model on the training dataset.
Train the Local Outlier Factor model on the training dataset.
**Model Prediction:**

Make predictions on the test dataset using both models.
Convert the predictions from -1, 1 to 0, 1 for consistency with the actual labels.
**Model Evaluation:**

Generate classification reports for both models to assess precision, recall, and F1-score.
Create confusion matrices for both models to visualize the performance.
**Visualization:**

Plot confusion matrices using heatmaps for a clear visual representation of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
**Results:**
The models are evaluated based on their ability to correctly classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
The performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score provide insights into the effectiveness of the models.
Confusion matrices help in understanding the distribution of correct and incorrect classifications.
